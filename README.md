# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Java Console Application)

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Java console-based application that I created while learning the basics of Java programming.  
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.  
After each guess, the program provides hints whether the guessed number is *too high* or *too low*.

This project helped me understand:
- How to take user input using `Scanner`
- How to generate random numbers using `Random` class
- Implementation of loops and conditional statements
- Basic flow control and logic building in Java
